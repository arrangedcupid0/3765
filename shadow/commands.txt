if you're doing an encrypted file

openssl pkeyutl -in secret.enc -out john.out -inkey key.pem -decrypt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt john.out

if you're doing zip

zip2john encrypted.zip > zip.hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip.hash

i know this is important but idk why
unshadow blank.shadow > fucj.pem


to show already cracked passwords
john --show <hash that you cracked>
