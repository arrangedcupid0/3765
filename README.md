These two parts represent the final project in the Intro to Cybersecurity class that I took in Spring '24.\

Steganography is what was used to encode the image included in that folder with a hidden message. Contained within "daybreaker.cpp", you'll find the code I used to break the encryption and return the decoded message to the user.
